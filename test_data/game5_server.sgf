C[WXY: The ko was yours to win... you had about 5 more ko threats than I did
BCD: Thanks most interesting Ko. Nearly forget what I was about in the top middle. 
WXY: The lower right corner, and Black #144 were big turning points in the game. Not sure why you played K13 and not the cut at K12?
BCD: A lot of poor reading as usual
BCD: Anyway, must go for this evening thanks again.
WXY: It was a good game. A couple of different plays and it would have been yours
WXY: thanks for the game!
